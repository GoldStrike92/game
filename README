Simple ping-pong browser game (using canvas and socket.io on the client
side). Node.js used as a back-end server.

To start the game you should install nodejs first 
(http://nodejs.org/#download)

Then start the server: 
$ sudo node server.js

Finally open two browser windows and point both to http://localhost:8081

Use 'Up' or 'Down' arrows to move your racket. Press Spacebar to start the round (only if two players are connected to the room)

Demo version: http://germaninthetown.com/pong

NB: since the site with demo is hosted in the US user could experience a little lag while playing if one or both players are from Europe or Asia

Tested and works in Google Chrome 8-9 and Firefox 4
