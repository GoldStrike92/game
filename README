Simple ping-pong browser game (using canvas/socket.io on client 
side). Nodejs used as back-end server

To start the game you should install nodejs first 
(http://nodejs.org/#download)

Then start the server: 
$ sudo node server.js

Then open two browser windows (currantly tested in Google Chrome only) 
and point both to http://localhost:8080

Move up - 'k'
Move down - 'l'
Start round - Spacebar
