Simple ping-pong browser game (using canvas and socket.io on the client
side). Node.js used as a back-end server.

To start the game you should install nodejs first 
(http://nodejs.org/#download)

Then start the server: 
$ sudo node server.js

Finally open two browser windows and point both to http://localhost:8080

Use Up/Down arrows to move your racket up and down. Hit Spacebar to start the round.
